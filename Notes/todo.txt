    [] Add Starting Face Direction for Player in Interiors...
    [x] Keep character animations all in sync (Global timer?)
    [x] Transfer Cutscene data to JSON
    [x] Make character animations always play ala Dragon Warrior 1
    [x] Teleport maybe doesn't have player go invisible right away???
