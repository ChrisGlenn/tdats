*** STORY NOTES ***

The Builder's Tools
Instead of using a typical RPG trope such as Crystals or Orbs, I have now switch it over to the 'Builder's Tools'. These tools are powerful enough to break the world. Left behind by the builders in case they are needed by the world's God.

The tools are:

Hammer
Chisel
Axe
Plane
Saw
Pick
Calipers

These are 'magical' items that possess great power and can't be handled by men without them dying instantly. Special magical equipment is used to handle these.
